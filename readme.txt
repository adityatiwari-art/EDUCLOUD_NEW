# EDUCLOUD

Welcome to **EDUCLOUD**, an educational website project designed to provide a comprehensive learning experience through videos and resources. This project utilizes a range of web technologies and is continuously evolving. Below you'll find an overview of the project, its current state, areas requiring further development, and future scopes.

## Project Overview

**EDUCLOUD** is built with the following technologies:

- **HTML**: For structuring the content.
- **CSS**: For styling the website.
- **JavaScript**: For client-side functionality.
- **Node.js**: For server-side logic.
- **MongoDB**: Used for basic user registration (requires enhancement for authentication).

## Current Features

- **Video Access**: Users can access educational videos. Currently, this feature relies on JavaScript objects to store video information. Future updates will integrate a more robust API for video management.
- **HTML Templates**: The site uses HTML templates, but there's a plan to migrate to **EJS** for dynamic templating.
- **Bootstrap Components**: For responsive design and UI components.

## Areas for Improvement

1. **Authentication**: The registration system is currently basic and lacks authentication. Enhancing this with a secure authentication mechanism is a priority.
2. **API Integration**: Transitioning from JavaScript objects to a dedicated API for video access is needed to streamline content management and retrieval.
3. **HTML Templates**: Replace the existing HTML templates with **EJS** to leverage dynamic rendering and improve maintainability.
4. **Axios vs Fetch API**: It is preferred to use **Axios** for API requests instead of the Fetch API for consistency and enhanced functionality.
5. **Programming Section**: The programming section is not functioning correctly and needs to be reviewed, modified, or removed.
6. **Responsiveness**: Ensure the website is fully responsive and performs well across various device sizes. Testing on different screen resolutions is required.

## Future Scopes

1. **Online Streaming Section**: Introduce an online streaming feature to allow live video sessions, webinars, and interactive lectures. This will enhance the educational experience by providing real-time content delivery.
2. **Chatbot Integration**: Implement a chatbot to assist users with common queries, guide them through the website, and provide real-time support. This will improve user interaction and make the platform more engaging.
